# E-commerce Application

# Overview

This project aims to build an E-commerce application using a modern technology stack. It will utilize a three-tier architecture with models, controllers, and services. The API will be developed with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript to create a RESTful API.

Application Type: E-commerce

# Technology Stack

Architecture: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
API Creation: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
API Type: REST API
Database: MongoDB
Database Library: Mongoose (MongoDB ODM)
Validation and Middleware: Zod
Security: RSA (Algorithm: RS256) for JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Authentication: Manual authentication with JWT and OAuth
Testing: Jest and Supertest
Caching: Redis
Additional Services:
ClickHouse (for data analysis)
Elasticsearch (for optimized search)
RabbitMQ (for notifications)
Monitoring:
Grafana (for monitoring and visualization)
Prometheus (for collecting and storing metrics)
Server Load Testing: Artillery

# Features

The application aims to provide standard E-commerce features including user registration, product management, order processing, and more.
Robust security measures with RSA and JWT for user authentication and data protection.
Robust testing with Jest to ensure the reliability of the application.
Caching with Redis for improved performance.
Integration with ClickHouse and Elasticsearch for data analysis and optimized search.
Asynchronous processing with RabbitMQ for notifications.
In-depth monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus for tracking server performance and issues.

# API Documentation: Swagger

Swagger Usage: The application will be documented using Swagger, a popular tool for API documentation. You can access the API documentation at http://base-url/docs. Swagger provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing your API endpoints.

# How to Use Swagger Documentation:

Access the API documentation by opening a web browser and going to http://base-url/docs.

Explore the API endpoints: Swagger provides a clear and user-friendly interface for all your API routes.

Test API endpoints: You can interact with your API by sending sample requests directly through the Swagger interface. This is invaluable for testing your endpoints during development.

# Installation and Usage

git clone + ssh or https
